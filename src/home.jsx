    <h1 className=""> Welcome to Golf Course</h1>
    <p className="">Beech Creek Golf Club is nested in the historic "High Hills of the Santee" and opened for play in 1989. The golf course is located on the site of "The Battle of Beech Creek" and is one of the most scenic piece of property in Sumter County, with elevation changes which allow for views that go on for miles. Unless the jets at nearby Shaw AFB are flying, you will be in for a completely serene atmosphere. Playing at 6800 yards from the back tees, Beech Creek offers an outstanding collection of holes that are challenging and fair.
Located 3 miles from Shaw AFB, 10 minutes from Sumter and 35 minutes from downtown Columbia, Beech Creek has easy access to I-20 and US 378/76.
